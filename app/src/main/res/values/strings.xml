        A Hobby Project which I took few months back. I created a website that allowed the admin to post articles. This is simply the Mobile App version of the same project. This project allowed me to understand about APIs, Android Activities etc. I used Git/Github as version control for this project. It is still undone and I\'m hoping to finish it soon ;)
